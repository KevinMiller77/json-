## JSON++
JSON++ is a modern c++ library to parse and emit JSON. I know plenty exist already but this one will be mine.

It is intended for use in the [Nebula](https://github.com/KevinMiller77/Nebula) game engine

### Goals
- Parse JSON to c/c++ types
- Emit JSON from c/c++ types 
- I'm sure more will come but this is all for now

### Usage
- Nothing to use
